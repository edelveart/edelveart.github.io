    title="Documentation of ts-tonnetz in web live coding environment TOPOS"
    img="/topos-docs.png"
    desc="Written in TypeScript, my 'ts-tonnetz' library is a dependence of Ziffers, a numerical notation system for algorithmic composition. Since December 2023, you can improvise with it within Topos (a new live coding environment designed by Raphaël Forment and Miika Alonen). Topos has exceptionally simplified but sufficient documentation of ts-tonnetz, where many of the ideas of 2 doctoral theses on mathematical music theory are explained (see Bigo, 2013; Cannas, 2018), among other most notable research articles on the area.

    title="A new library in npm for live coders: TS-TONNETZ"
    img="/ts-tonnetz.png"
    desc="A complete library of Neo-Riemannian Theory (67 functions and many graphs) written in TypeScript  for musicians, mathematicians and engineers interested in Mathematical Music Theory. It is based on two doctoral theses and notable articles on the subject. It is a perfect access point to this fascinating area where music, mathematics and computing at the highest level come together. Playing with ts-tonnetz will lead you to propose questions and new musical systems in an expressive and creative way."

    img="/figurate_numbers.png"
    desc="This Ruby gem enables the generation of 206 infinite sequences of plane, spatial, and multidimensional figurate numbers, as described in the book ‘Figurate Numbers’ (2012) by Elena Deza and Michel Deza. The methods, implemented using the Enumerator class, are designed for use in your math projects or in Sonic Pi."
