export const SITE_DESCRIPTION =
  "I develop creative systems that merge mathematics, computation, and music, exploring how these fields can mutually enrich each other through structural analogies. My current projects include modular forms (SageMath/LMFDB-inspired) and ts-tonnetz, both for real-time algorithmic composition, as well as multidimensional figurate number generators with over 18,000 downloads. I have published an article indexed in Scopus on Mathematical Music Theory, contribute to international open-source projects, and teach at the postgraduate level.";
