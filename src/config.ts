  "I develop modular_forms, an interactive interface for exploring modular forms and elliptic curves in real time through musical algorithms, designed for live coders interested in number theory. In 2023, I launched ts-tonnetz, an algorithmic composition package integrated into Topos (https://topos.live/#ziffers_tonnetz). My libraries on figurate numbers have surpassed 14,000 downloads. Previously, I published an article indexed in Scopus on Mathematical Music Theory. In addition to teaching at the graduate level, I collaborate on international open-source projects.";
