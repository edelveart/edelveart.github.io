  "I design creative systems that integrate mathematical structures with computational tools for live coders, musicians, and curious minds. I currently develop modular forms, inspired by SageMath and LMFDB, and ts-tonnetz, two packages for real-time algorithmic composition. Moreover, my libraries for generating multidimensional figurate numbers have surpassed 17,000 downloads. I have published an article indexed in Scopus on Mathematical Music Theory, teach at the postgraduate level, and contribute to international open-source projects.";
