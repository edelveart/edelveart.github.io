## A Remark

During the development of multidimensional figurate number generators in my libraries **figuratenum** and **figurate_numbers**, I encoded several sequences using the factorial and its companions.

Both the rising factorial $n^{\overline{k}}$ and the classical factorial, a special case of the falling factorial $k^{\underline{k}}$, are perhaps at their core a very natural way of counting dimensions and building geometric universes through monotonic multiplications along complementary paths.

Yet, seeking a different perspective to address my concerns, I often think of sequences as an enriched, flowing, serpentine wave connecting the discrete world of counting with the continuity of analysis (inspired by [Artin's book](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/Artin-TheGammaFunction.pdf)).
The order in which I present the following winding identities simply reflects my personal taste.

$$
H_k(n)=\frac{n(n+1) \cdots (n + k - 1)}{k(k-1)(k-2) \cdots 1}
$$

$$
= \frac{ \prod_{i=0}^{k-1} (n + i)}{ \prod_{i=0}^{k-1} (k-i)} =  \frac{n^{\overline{k}}}{k^{\underline{k}}}
$$

$$
= \frac{\dfrac{\Gamma(n + k)}{\Gamma(n)}}{\Gamma(k + 1)} = \frac{\Gamma(n + k)}{\Gamma(n) \, \Gamma(k + 1)}
$$

$$
= \frac{n^{\overline{k}}}{k!}
= \binom{n + k - 1}{k}
$$

$$
 = \frac{ \int_0^\infty \tau^{n+k-1} e^{-\tau} \ d\tau}
{\left( \int_0^\infty \tau^{n-1} e^{-\tau} \ d\tau \right) \left( \int_0^\infty \tau^k e^{-\tau} \ d\tau \right)}.
$$


All these expressions unite in the object: `k_hypertetrahedron` $H_k(n)$, where combinatorics geometry and analysis converge.
Seen through the lens of the Gamma function it becomes malleable and extends to fractional or complex values $H_k(z)$, provided the constraints on the real part are respected.

## What are the alternative of generators?

I have thought of building generators as a form of navigation. It is not just about producing sequences, but about following a winding path through ideas, like a symbolic river.

```py
def generalized_k_dimensional_hyperoctahedron(k: int = 5, start_num: int = 1) -> Generator[int]:
    """Incrementally optimized generalized hyperoctahedron generator."""
    den = factorial(k)
    bin_coeffs = [binomial_coefficient(k - 1, i) for i in range(k)]
    delta = start_num
    risings = [rising_factorial(delta - i, k) for i in range(k)]
    while True:
        yield sum(bin_coeffs[i] * risings[i] // den for i in range(k))
        delta += 1
        for i in range(k):
            d_m_i_m_1 = delta - i - 1
            if d_m_i_m_1 != 0:
                risings[i] = risings[i] * (d_m_i_m_1 + k) // d_m_i_m_1
            else:
                risings[i] = rising_factorial(delta - i, k)
```

Though implementations may seem rigid for efficiency, these figurate number formulas remain adaptable, able to evolve and flow through topological structures across dimensions.

I always keep these ideas in mind as the conceptual foundation for designing generators more deeply rooted in different mathematical spaces. In that spirit, I hold on to this question:

> If the symbolic expressions that define the figurate number in dimension $k$ are themselves the first elements generated by that figurate number:  What new definition, equivalent yet amplified, whether combinatorial, geometric, algebraic, or analytic, emerges in a given dimension $k$ and span $n$?
